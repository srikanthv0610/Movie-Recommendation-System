# Movie Recommendation System: a) Content-Based Filterning, b) Collaborative Filtering 
A Movie Recommender System to estimate the top N movies that a user is likely to watch based on:
1) **Content-Based Filtering:** Here we use the variables: Movie title, Actors, Director and Genre to make recommendations based on this

## Descriptive Statistics:
We determine how many times the movies have been rated to create the count variable:

Represents the histogram for the number of ratings

![Plot2](https://github.com/srikanthv0610/Movie-Recommendation-System/blob/main/plots/Figure_2.png)
* Here we observe that the integer rating values have taller bars compared to the floating values.
* The rating data are approximately normally distributed with a mean approximately = 3.5.  

![Plot3](https://github.com/srikanthv0610/Movie-Recommendation-System/blob/main/plots/Figure_3.png).
* The scatter plot between average ratings and number of ratings.
* We obseve a positive relation between the two variables, i.e movie with large amount of ratings have higher average ratings.

## Result:
